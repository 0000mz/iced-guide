# Welcome to the unofficial iced-rs guide 

Iced is an Open Source GUI library written in rust to create beautiful and minimal cross platform applications. It leverages the power of Google's [Skia](https://skia.org/) (via [tiny-skia](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/tiny-skia)) and wGPU to render beautiful UI while maintaining clean and maintainable code by using the ELM (or MVU) architecture.

Iced focuses on Simplicity and type-safety so that you can concenterate on your implementation without any framework specific distractions.

This guide tries to explain the basics of the Iced GUI library for the Rust programming language.
